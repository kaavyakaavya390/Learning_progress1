Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, meaning code can run anywhere with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
It follows principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
Java offers automatic memory management with garbage collection and supports multithreading for concurrent execution. 
Its vast standard library (API) covers everything from file handling to networking. 
Java is widely used in web development, Android apps, enterprise software, and big data systems. 
With strong security features, Java ensures safe execution in controlled environments. 
Regular updates make it a versatile and reliable choice for developers.
Java Components
